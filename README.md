# 👋 Hi, I'm Christopher Brugnoli
 
### Data Analyst | Python • R • SQL • Power BI • Excel
 
I'm an entry-level data analyst with a B.S. in Data Analytics (SNHU) and a B.S. in Biology (Mars Hill University). My background spans healthcare, zoological operations, and high-volume theme park environments — and across all of them, the common thread has been collecting, tracking, and making sense of data.
 
I build predictive models, design tracking systems, run statistical analyses, and turn messy datasets into clear insights. This portfolio showcases the projects I've completed across machine learning, statistical modeling, SQL database design, and data visualization.

### 🦁 Wildlife Drone Impact Analysis
**Tools:** R, ANOVA, Regression, Meta-Analysis
 
Original meta-analysis across **12 peer-reviewed studies** covering **25 animal-drone combinations** examining how drone activity affects wildlife behavior. Used one-way ANOVA and regression to test whether drone type, animal taxa, or body mass predicted minimum safe flight height.
 
**Key Findings:**
- Fixed-wing drones require **220m** average flight height vs. **50m** for rotary drones (F=23.48, p<0.0001)
- Mammals were significantly more affected than birds or reptiles (p=0.03)
- Body mass (intelligence proxy) showed no significant effect on drone response
- Recommended rotary drones with model-specific height protocols for field research

### 💳 Credit Risk Predictive Modeling
**Tools:** R, Logistic Regression, Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC Analysis
 
Built and compared two logistic regression models to predict credit card default risk using customer variables including credit utilization, education level, asset ownership, and missed payment history.
 
**Model Performance:**
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | AUC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model 1 (Utilization + Education) | 92.83% | 93.23% | 98.59% |
| Model 2 (Utilization + Assets + Missed Payments) | 94.16% | 95.58% | 98.74% |
 
**Key Findings:**
- Credit utilization was the strongest predictor of default
- Missing even one payment dramatically increased default probability
- Model 2 recommended for deployment given higher precision and AUC

### 🏭 Manufacturing Defect Reduction
**Tools:** Python, Power BI, ANOVA, Pareto Analysis
 
Analyzed **3,150 welding defects** across three double production lines at an electronics manufacturing facility. Used Pareto analysis in Power BI to identify the vital few models driving the majority of defects, then validated findings with one-way ANOVA in Python.
 
**Key Findings:**
- Top 3 production models accounted for **69% of all defects**
- ANOVA confirmed Model 595130-195 was statistically worse than peers (F=26.33, p=1.49×10⁻¹⁰)
- Identified model-specific root causes: assembly/presence errors vs. solder process failures
- Recommendations projected to reduce defects by **20%** while increasing line capacity

### ⛈️ Storm Events & Crime Analysis
**Tools:** SQL, R, Python, Power BI, Excel, Time Series
 
Analyzed the correlation between storm events and criminal activity in Miami, Florida (2017–2019) using joined datasets from the National Weather Service Storm Events Database and Miami Police Department crime records.
 
**Key Findings:**
- Storm-related crimes generated **$50K** in cumulative losses vs. **$18K** during non-storm periods
- Gap between storm and non-storm crime losses widened consistently across the 3-year period
- Thunderstorm Wind and Hurricane events correlated with highest-value crimes (burglary, auto theft)
- Delivered structured analysis report formatted as a professional consulting job aid for new analysts

### 👥 Employee Attrition Prediction
**Tools:** Python, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Scikit-Learn, Pandas
 
Merged two HR datasets (1,470 employees, 30 features) and built machine learning models to identify the primary drivers of employee turnover and predict which employees are most at risk of leaving.
 
**Model Performance:**
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | 85% | 80% | 52% |
| AdaBoost | 84% | 78% | 50% |
 
**Key Findings:**
- Attrition risk peaks in the first few years and again near the 20-year mark
- Employees rating job satisfaction as "3" showed unexpectedly high attrition — flagged as disengagement risk
- Manager instability was a consistent attrition driver across departments
- Recommended early-career onboarding improvements and manager retention strategies

### ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Modeling
**Tools:** R, Python, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
 
Developed classification models on a **303-patient medical dataset** to predict heart disease risk using clinical indicators. Modeled for potential clinical application to support early risk identification in patient records.
 
**Variables Used:** Age, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, maximum heart rate achieved
 
**Key Findings:**
- Maximum heart rate achieved was a significant positive predictor of heart disease risk
- Logistic regression model passed Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (p=0.612)
- Random Forest added non-linear pattern detection for improved classification

### 🗄️ SQL Database Design & Analysis
**Tools:** MySQL, SQL, Codio

**Projects include:**
- **QuantigrationUpdates Database** — full schema creation, customer/order/RMA table design
- **Product Return Analysis** — multi-table JOIN queries analyzing return rates by state and product type
- **Employee Database Lab** — department join queries, aggregate functions, grouped reporting

**Work included:**
- Identified and categorized 5 categories of data anomalies with resolution plans
- Designed Excel transformation functions to standardize location keys, customer types, gender encoding, and time slots
- Documented data sensitivity protocols for customer and employee PII fields
